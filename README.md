Description TBD :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Ionic](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
We use [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) for the native app builds.

## Project Setup

The project has been developed using NodeJS.

In case you want to build an Android or iOS app you need to install the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) as well.

After cloning this repository and cd into it, please run `npm i` command, in order to install all the package dependencies.

## Bundling the application

### Web

Run the command `ionic serve` which should serve your project locally and open a localhost instance.

### Android

_Requires Ionic CLI and Android Studio._

Run the command `npx cap open android` to open the project with Android Studio and then `npx cap run android` to run the app in your pluged devide or in a simulator.

### iOS

_Requires Ionic CLI, XCode and a Mac machine._

Not developed yet but Capacitor iOS apps are configured and managed with Xcode and CocoaPods.
